    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
        I really liked this explanation of the variables since I had always seen them as boxes <br>
        You should imagine bindings as tentacles, rather than boxes. They do not contain values; they grasp themâ€”two bindings can refer to the same value. A program can access only the values that it still has a reference to. When you need to remember something, you grow a tentacle to hold on to it or you reattach one of your existing tentacles to it.

    <h3>Conditional execution</h3>
    <p>
        Conditional execution is created with the if keyword in JavaScript. In the simple case, we want some code to be executed if, and only if, a certain condition holds.

    <h3>while and do loops</h3>
    <p>
        Looping control flow allows us to go back to some point in the program where we were before and repeat it with our current program state.
