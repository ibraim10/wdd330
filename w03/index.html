    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <h3>This</h3>
    <p>The keyword this refers to the object that it is within. It can be used inside methods to gain access to the object’s properties.</p>



    <h3>Object Literals</h3>
    <p>
        An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions. They act as a collection of named properties that map to any JavaScript value such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and functions. If a property’s value is a function, it is known as a method. <br>
        To create an object literal, simply enter a pair of curly braces. <br>
        To access the properties of an object using the dot notation <br>
        Also you can access an object’s properties using bracket notation
    </p>
    <p>   
        As mentioned earlier, objects can inherit properties from other objects, so all objects have a method called hasOwnProperty(). This can be used to check whether an object has a property that is its own, rather than one that has been inherited from another object:
    </p>

    <h3>JSON</h3>
    <p>
        JSON is a string representation of the object literal notation that we have just seen <br>

        The parse() method takes a string of data in JSON format and returns a JavaScript object <br>
        The stringify() method does the opposite, taking a JavaScript object and returning a string of JSON data
    </p>


    <h3>The Date Object</h3>
    <p>
        Constructor Function
        A constructor function is used to create a new date object using the new operator: <br> 
        const today = new Date(); <br>
        The variable today now points to a Date object. To see what the date is, we use the toString() method that all objects have: <br>
        today.toString(); <br>
        << 'Tue Feb 14 2017 16:35:18 GMT+0000 (GMT)' <br>
        new Date(year,month,day,hour,minutes,seconds,milliseconds) <br>
    
        The getDay() and getUTCDay() methods are used to find the day of the week that the date object falls on. It returns a number, starting at 0 for Sunday <br>
    
    
        The getDate() and getUTCDate() methods return the day of the month for the date object <br>
    
        The getMonth() and getUTCMonth() methods can be used to find the month of the date object. It returns an integer, but remember to count from 0; so January is 0, February is 1 <br>
    
        The getFullYear() and getUTCFullYear() methods return the year of the date object.  <br>
        There are also getHours() 
    </p>

    <h3>The RegExp Object</h3>
    <p>
        A regular expression (or RegExp, for short) is a pattern that can be used to search strings for matches to the pattern. A common use is 'find and replace' type operations. For example, say you were looking for any word ending in 'ing', you could use the regular expression /[a-zA-Z]+ing$/. <br>

        Creating Regular Expressions <br>
        There are two ways to create a regular expression. The first, and preferred way, is to use the literal notation of writing the regular expression between forward slashes
